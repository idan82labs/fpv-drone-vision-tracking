# Status

## Honest Read

The system has made progress, but the remaining problem is still hard.

Current capability:

- Proposals can often include the visible drone.
- Temporal-stack proposal recovery improved oracle recall on the hard e271 tail.
- The labeler and review workflow now support hard-negative mining and frame-level drone marking.

Current blocker:

- The autonomous ranker still picks plausible clutter too often.
- More candidate count alone is not a reliable improvement.

## Recent Numbers

From the v3 tail-extended labels:

- Baseline strict: 465/677 = 68.7%
- Baseline loose: 576/677 = 85.1%
- Logistic strict: 477/677 = 70.5%
- Logistic loose: 594/677 = 87.7%
- ExtraTrees strict: 491/677 = 72.5%
- ExtraTrees loose: 587/677 = 86.7%

From the v4 e271 proposal-recovery diagnostic:

- Temporal-stack proposal layer, best standalone source: `temporal_dark`
- R@80 = 0.539 overall
- R@200 = 0.730 overall
- R@500 = 0.910 overall
- High-confidence R@80 = 0.755

Interpretation: the target is often present somewhere in the proposal pool, but the ranker does not reliably select it.

## Next Meaningful Work

1. Train a tube-level ranker on hard top-tube alternatives.
2. Add target-aligned versus background-aligned crop-stack features.
3. Keep mining hard negatives from terrain, cloud, skyline, poles, and static hot spots.
4. Calibrate thresholds from null-window max-score distributions.
5. Only after the ranking problem improves, revisit heavier proposal generation.
